# XMODEL: The Fastest Analog/Mixed-Signal Simulator in SystemiVerilog


<!-- Page 2 -->
# EMPOWER SYSTEMVERILOG WITH ANALOG MODELS

## What is XMODEL?

XMODEL turns your SystemVerilog simulator into a powerful analog/mixed-signal simulator. With XMODEL, you can verify functionality and estimate performance of various large-scale mixed-signal systems, all on a single simulation platform, SystemVerilog.

### XMODEL Ecosystem

XMODEL operates together with the following tools and modules:

- **Core**
  - XMODEL Simulation Engine
  - XMODEL Primitives Library
  - SystemVerilog Simulator (VCS®, NC-Verilog®, ModelSim®)

- **Integrated Tools**
  - XWAVE Waveform Viewer
  - GLISTER Model Netlister
  - XMULAN Python Library
  - MODELFIT
  - MODELZEN
  - MODELBOX

- **Capabilities**
  - Statistical Simulation
  - Circuit-Level Modeling
  - Co-simulation with SPICE

## Why is XMODEL Fast and Accurate?

XMODEL uses revolutionary, patent-pending algorithms to accurately express and quickly compute analog wave­ forms in SystemVerilog, achieving a typical speed-up of 10-l00x compared to Verilog-AMS or Real-Number Verilog for the same accuracy.

### XMODEL (Event-Driven)

## Compose and Simulate Analog Models in GUI Environment

XMODEL offers intuitive graphical user interface when integrated into Cadence® DFII environment.

## Run Hyper-Fast Statistical Simulation

XMODEL can perform time-domain noise simulation, e.g. measuring the BER of a wireline receiver in 10 seconds!

## Express Circuit-Level Models in SystemVerilog

Unlike Real-Number Verilog, XMODEL supports circuit-level models in SystemVerilog without invoking SPICE.

## Download Models and Testbenches from MODELBOX

XMODEL users can access a vast repository of models and testbenches through our support website.

# CREATE ANALOG MODELS WITH PEACE OF MIND

## Top-Down Modeling with XMODEL Primitives

With a rich set of XMODEL primitives, you can easily compose your ideas into functional models of analog/mixed-signal circuits.

## Bottom-Up Modeling with MODELFIT/MODELZEN

MODELFIT and MODELZEN are two effective tools for extracting models from circuits.
 * **MODELFIT** calibrates the parameters of your functional models against SPICE simulation.
 * **MODELZEN** translates any circuit netlist into an equivalent XMODEL circuit-level model.

## Model Verification with Co-simulation

You can also co-simulate SPICE netlists with XMODEL testbench toverify the model's correctness against circuit.

# About Scientific Analog, Inc.

**Scientific Analog, Inc.** was founded in 2015 with a mission to make analog circuit design as systematic and productive as digital design. In particular, we believe that a proper use of analog models is the key to successful design and verification of today's mixed-signal system-on-chips. XMODEL is our first step towards this mission, achieving fast and accurate simulation of analog models by leveraging their linear abstraction. Currently, more than 20 companies and universities located in U.S.A., Korea, China, and India are using XMODEL. Our next step is to develop design libraries and tools that enable an ASIC-like, cell-based design flow for analog/mixed-signal systems.
